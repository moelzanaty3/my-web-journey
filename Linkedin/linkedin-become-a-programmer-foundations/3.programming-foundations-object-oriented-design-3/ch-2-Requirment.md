## NOTES 

### [FURPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FURPS)
- ***FURPS*** is an acronym representing a model for classifying software quality attributes *(functional and non-functional requirements)*
  - **Functionality** 
    - Capability (Size & Generality of Feature Set)
    - Reusability (Compatibility, Interoperability, Portability) 
    - Security (Safety & Exportability)

  - **Usability** (UX) - Human Factors, Aesthetics, Consistency, Documentation, Responsiveness
    
  - **Reliability** 
    - Availability (Failure Frequency (Robustness/Durability/Resilience)
    - Failure Extent & Time-Length (Recoverability/Survivability))
    - Predictability (Stability)
    - Accuracy (Frequency/Severity of Error)

  - **Performance** - Speed, Efficiency, Resource Consumption (power, ram, cache, etc.), Throughput, Capacity, Scalability

  - **Supportability** (Serviceability, Maintainability, Sustainability, Repair Speed) - Testability, Flexibility (Modifiability, Configurability, Adaptability, Extensibility, Modularity), Installability, Localizability

### [Functional and Non Functional Requirements](https://www.guru99.com/functional-requirement-specification-example.html)
- **A Functional Requirement (FR)** is a description of the service that the software must offer

- **Nonfunctional Requirements (NFRs)** define system attributes such as security, reliability, performance, maintainability, scalability, and usability. They serve as constraints or restrictions on the design of the system across the different backlogs.
