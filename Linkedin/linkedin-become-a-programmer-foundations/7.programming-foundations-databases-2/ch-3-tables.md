## Notes
- Entity Relationship Diagram (ER Diagram)
  - A diagram that uses tables, fields and relationships to plan a database 
- You can't create your database without knowing the basics of the tables, their columns, and how data will be related.
- Referential Integrity 
  - DB are aware of relationships and won't allow user to modify data in a way tha violates those relationships.
    -Ex. preventing the user from entering a record that refers to nonexistent data


- Cascade Delete 
  - if you delete a record and the database goes on and deletes other records associated with that record
- Defining relationships helps you to
  - Model real world scenarios and requirements 
  - Reduce the repetition of data across tables 
  - Understand how your data should be stored
- The foreign key points to the primary key for the 'one' side of the relationship.
- A one-to-one relationship allows only one record to be connected to only one other record
