### Scrum
   * Lightweight
   * Simple to understand
   * Difficult to master
   * A framework that can help teams build complex products.
   * Is a lightweight framework not a methodology. 
   * Is not a process, technique, or definitive method
   * Is abstract and not perspective. 
   * First gained widespread popularity in 1995 when presented by `Ken Schwarber` and `Jeff Sutherland`. 
   * Has only 
        1. Three Roles 
            - Product Owner 
                - Defines what will be built and in what order.
                - Represent the vision and direction of stockholders. 
                - Anyone on Scrum team may change the product backlog, but must do it with product owner's knowledge.
                - Is Accountable for the product backlog 
                - define what's need to build in sprint planning and in what order
            - Development Team Member
                - Defines how the backlog items will we converting into an iteration of working product.
                - Function writing code, testing, write documentation 
                - It recommended size to be from 3-9 people.
                - Must be self-organized and operates with minimal input from external sources.
                - owns the entire sprint backlog (selected product backlog items, plus development tasks)
                - There is no managers or team leads -- it is a lat hierarchy.  
            - Scrum Master
                - Scrum Expert and agile coach
                - coach all involved to apply scrum 
                - resolve any issue btw development team or product owner.
                - facilitate the process by addressing impediments or obstacles the prevent development team from get thier job done. 
                - adopted at enterprise level
                - work with other scrum master within the organization 
                - is a management role, but is considered a servant leader and not a top-down manager. 
        2. Five Events 
            - Sprint
                - The is the work period to produce an iteration of the workable product.
            - Sprint Planning.
                - The scrum team defines what development team works on and how they will execute the plan During sprint.
            - Daily Scrum.
                - The development team meat everyday to inspect their work and adapt it to be more efficient. 
                - An opportunity for the Development Team to synchronize their work.
            - Sprint Review.
                - The Scrum Team reviews their work and progress that occurred during the sprint.
                - Include a informal product review by external stakeholders which includes showing to the stakeholders what has been built. 
                  The Product "Demo" is generally not scripted and it is not the only item included in the Sprint Review. 
                  A general guideline is to let the stakeholders try product features instead of just watching a demo of the product. 
                  Additionally, the Sprint Review also includes future planning based on latest market conditions and enterprise goal.
            - Sprint Retrospective.
                - The scrum team gets together to discuss how they can be more efficient 
        3. Three Artifacts
            - The Product Backlog.
            - The Sprint Backlog.
            - The Product Increment `[ Product at each sprint ]`.
   * Scrum Sprints
        - Sprint Goal is the high-level goal of each time-boxed sprint written as concisely as possible.
        - The Development Team then plans how to convert the goal items into a product increment 
        - The sprint backlog is a subset of the product backlog and contains items selected 
          for the sprint, plus additional items for the development team.
   * Empiricism
        - Predictive approach + 30 Minutes.
        - Estimate solely based on experience.
   * Based on three key style of execution `[ Three Pillars of Scrum ]`
        1. Transparency 
        2. Inspection 
        3. Adaptation 
   * Scrum Values 
        1. Focus 
            - Time-boxed events facilitate focused work
        2. Respect 
        3. Openness 
        4. Courage 
            - Continuous inspection and adaptation of work requires a degree of courage. 
        5. Commitment
            - Scrum requires a  commitment to agile principles to be successful.
   * Common Myths
        1. Daily Scrum is status meeting  
        2. Using agile software tools makes your team agile.
        3. Agile teams do not document  
        4. Agile teams do not design  
        5. Sprint reviews are product demos  
   * **The Manifesto expressed that working software is more important than comprehensive documentation **
