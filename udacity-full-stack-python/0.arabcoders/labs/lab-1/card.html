        <p id="interesting-fact">The lion is one of the largest species in the family Felidae; it is a muscular,
            deep-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck and round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of
            its tail.</p>

                <span>Scientific Name</span>: Panthera leo

            </li>
            <li>
                <span>Habitat</span>: grassland — savanna
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p id="summary">Typically, the lion inhabits grasslands and savannas but is absent in dense forests. It is
            usually more diurnal than other big cats, but when persecuted it adapts to being active at night and at
            twilight. In the Pleistocene, the lion ranged throughout Eurasia, Africa and North America but today it has
            been reduced to fragmented populations in Sub-Saharan Africa and one critically endangered population in
            western India.
